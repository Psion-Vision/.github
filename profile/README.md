# PSION VISION

We specialise in maintenance planning and structural integrity management, developing innovative support solutions for the UK Ministry of Defence. In 2015 the British army adopted our maintenance support philosophy for managing their major warfighting equipment's.

We also developed the world first science based structural integrity management software solution for armoured fighting vehicles, which was designed to replace the long standing and outdated scheduled based maintenance approach with one based on risk and condition. The project which ran for 8 years and was supported by DSTL is capable of determining the structural condition of the asset, itâ€™s maintenance requirements and survivability in battle. In 2015 the Ministry of Defence successfully used the software to determine the condition of 63 Challenger 2 main battle tanks as part of the governments Strategic Defence Review.

We moved into the smart eyewear market back in early 2018 when we were sponsored by the UK space agency to develop the technology for the defence market.

**Our focus on smart eyewear solutions has enabled us to work with clients across a number of sectors including maritime and aviation industry.**
